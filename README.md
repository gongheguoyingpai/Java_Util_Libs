I create this project to write some useful and often used java class.
for example, some time we need to get a file's create time or modified time.

Now it contains:

* TimeUtil : This Class can help you get a file's create time and last modify time.

* PathUtil : We know in python or other script languages have some function to make path operation very easy, so now you can use this class to make it as easy as those script languages.
